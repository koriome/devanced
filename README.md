# Devanced

a website with the goal of making every minecraft streamer's lives worse.

worked on by [koriome](https://korio.me) and [loganrithm](https://twitter.com/loganrithmlive). inspired by [affonic](https://twitch.tv/affonic)

you can visit the website at https://devanced.korio.me although at the moment there isn't anything there.

## progress for nerds

The site is currently *not operational!* like, there isn't shit done besides the idea of it all.

Goals:
- Track twitch events and assign coins to users based on activity in a channel
- Use coins earned to undo advancements, give/take items, screw with the game

Short term to-dos:
- figure out how databases work (help)
- get twitch auth working
- create a button that does **something** in minecraft
